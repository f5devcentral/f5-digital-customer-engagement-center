Filing issues
=============

If you run into any issues while working with the project, you should submit them in github.

For us to triage as quickly as possible, please follow these guidelines.

Be verbose
----------

When you file an issue with the project, an Issue template appears.

Please provide as much information as possible.

Some things we need to know:

- Which solution
- What is your environment 


The Issue template asks these questions.

If the issue seems to be a bug, add the label `bug-report` to it.

Some of the things that we  **do not** want, and will **never** ask for are:

- passwords
- license keys
- **public** disclosure of your company or company contact info
- credentials of any type


Do not comment on closed issues

**Important:** Please do not comment on closed issues.
