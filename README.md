# F5 Digital Customer Engagement Center Repository
F5 Digital Engagement Center Code Repository

[Project Documentation in ReadTheDocs](https://f5-digital-customer-engagement-center.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
## Overview
This project will be utilized to demo and provide reusable configurations for F5 Digital Engagement Center labs and roadshows

## Getting Started
This repository and its examples are meant to support a bring your own credentials approach.
the credentials can be obtained through an F5 UDF course deployment, or your own cloud credentials.

## Installation

This project can be run with or without the provided container for development or [**devcontainer.**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers)

### Devcontainer TLDR
  - Requirements:
      - [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
      - [ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack)
      - [docker](https://www.docker.com/)
      - [wsl2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) on windows workstations
  - Running:
    - open vscode command pallet
      - >Remote-Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container
## Usage

The project is meant to deliver a framework for creation solutions using common or customized modules.


### Solutions
  Each solution will:
  - Explain which infrastructure it requires
      - readme.md
  - Provide step by step instructions to deploy the required infrastructure and configure it mirroring the scripts
    - formatting for readthedocs
  - Contain scripts to:
    - Deploy the required infrastructure
      - setup.sh
    - Create the required configuration
      - demo.sh
          - demo script is meant to be a wrapper for the scripts you want to use to configure your deployed solution infrastructure.
          the most common scenario of using ansible through a docker container, is permitted by the privileged devcontainer.
    - Destroy the required infrastructure
      - cleanup.sh
  - Accept variables
    - auto.tfvars.example
      an example of available variables for the infrastructure
  - Export variables
    - Solutions should be addressable as terraform modules, this requires they output relevant connection information in a standardized way.
  - Be responsible for any IAM objects needed
  - Create and manage any security groups/firewall rules needed by the solution.
  - Include defaults not present in the auto.tvfars when using terraform
  - Provide an auto.tfvars example when using terraform

a sample solution template is available in **~/solutions/solution_template**

---
### Modules
Each module will:
- Attempt to use community or vendor supported modules first
- Export consistent outputs following project naming [standards](contributing.md)
- Include a 'tests' folder with code to deploy the module. this should be used by the module developer and not to be used externally.
- README file which details the inputs/outputs and usage
- Work with existing networks
a sample module template is available in **~/modules/aws/terraform/network/min**
---
### Devcontainer
The container will:
- provide current releases of:
  - Terraform
  - Ansible
  - pre-commit
  - aws-cli
  - azure-cli
  - gcloud-cli

---
## Development

checking for secrets as well as linting is performed by git pre-commit with the module requirements handled in the devcontainer.

testing pre-commit hooks:
  ```bash
  # test pre commit manually
  pre-commit run -a -v
  ```
---
## Troubleshooting
module not pulling in changes:
  - force module update
    ```bash
    terraform get -update
    ```
