## Requirements

- Solution was tested only on us-west-2, the region has to support GWLB.
- Subscribe to the F5 PAYG-Best 1Gbps image from the AWS marketplace - https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-atilk7h6dqu6k?ref_=srh_res_product_title

## Usage example

- Set AWS environment variables
```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your_key"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your_secret_key"
```

create the vars file and update it with your settings

```bash
cp admin.auto.tfvars.example admin.auto.tfvars
# MODIFY TO YOUR SETTINGS
```

run the setup script to deploy all of the components into your AWS account (remember that you are responsible for the cost of those components)

```bash
./setup.sh
```

## BIGIP configuration steps

Connect to the BIGIP using the bigipPublicIp and bigipPassword over port 8443. https://quickstart:bigipPassword@bigipPublicIp:8443

Username: quickstart

Password: bigipPassword output value

Please note it takes a few minutes for the BIGIP to complete the onboarding process, once it's done you will be able to ssh into the jumphost.

The BIGIP gets deployed with a forwarding virtual server to route accept the traffic inside the GENEVE tunnel and apply relevant security controls on it. It also comes with a basic AFM policy that logs all packets locally and blocks telnet (tcp port 23).


## TEST your setup:


SCP your ssh keys to the jumphost (For Testing only, don't use long lived SSH keys)

```bash
scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ubuntu@44.230.225.53:~/.ssh/
```

using your ssh key, connect to the  Jumphost - ubuntuJumpHostAz1

```bash
ssh ubuntu@x.y.z.p
```

from the public jumphost, try to SSH to the internal Jumphost
try to telnet the internal jumphost and notice your connection is being rejected (tcp reset)
monitor the traffic in AFM, you should see traffic between the public jumphost and the internal one.

## Cleanup
use the following command to destroy all of the resources

```bash
./destroy.sh
```

## Requirements

No requirements.
